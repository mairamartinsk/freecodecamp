      <blockquote class="quote1 boxy">"I used to be embarrassed because I was just a comic-book writer while other people were building bridges or going on to medical careers. And then I began to realize: entertainment is one of the most important things in people's lives. Without it they might go off the deep end. I feel that if you're able to entertain people, you're doing a good thing."</blockquote>

        <h3>Comics & Graphic Novels</h3>
        <p>In 1939, a teenage Stan Lee began his career in comics and almost eight decades later, he is celebrated as the creative tour de force behind Marvel’s Silver Age - the co-creator of beloved characters like Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four, Hulk, Thor and the X-Men. Here is a bit of his legacy:</p>
        <p><strong>CAPTAIN AMERICA COMICS #3 (1941) - First Work</strong> - Lee’s first writing was providing filler text in this Golden Age Captain America story, written by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby. A career in comics begins!</p>
        <p><strong>AMAZING FANTASY #15 (1962) - Radioactive Spider-Man</strong> - Peter Parker makes his Marvel debut! Lee’s inspiration for Spider-Man came of his desire to depict an adolescent hero who wasn’t relegated to sidekick. Finding spiders ‘spooky’, Stan and artist Steve Ditko created Marvel’s most globally recognized hero.</p>
        <p><strong>UNCANNY X-MEN (1963) - Dawn of Mutants</strong> - Following the success of Spider-Man and Hulk, Lee and Kirby developed a new team of heroes with inborn powers. The series was originally to be titled “The Mutants”, but was changed to the even more cryptic “X-Men” and featured a mostly teenage team. Read the very first Avengers vs. X-Men story!</p>

        <h3>Stan on the big screen</h3>
        <p>Stan once said: <em>"I'm a frustrated actor. My goal is to beat Alfred Hitchcock in the number of cameos. I'm going to try to break his record."</em></p>
        <p>With more than 30 cameos and counting, here are some of his most memorable scenes:</p>
        <p><strong>DR STRANGE (2016)</strong> - Stan Lee appears during a battle between Strange and Mordo. They are forced up against the bus window, but Lee doesn’t even blink, as he’s completely absorbed in his book.</p>
        <p><strong>BIG HERO 6 (2014)</strong> - Stan plays himself in the post credits scene of the animated movie.</p>
        <p><strong>SPIDER MAN (2002)</strong> - When Spider-Man and the Green Goblin face off for the first time, Stan Lee can be spotted in the panicked crowds below. He even has a heroic moment of his own, as he scoops up a little girl and pulls her to safety.</p>
        <p><strong>HULK (2003)</strong> - This film marked the first time that Stan Lee got a speaking role in a Marvel cameo, playing a security guard. His first line? <em>“Security oughta be beefed up a lot more in a place like this.”</em></p>

        <h3>A few Curiosities</h3>
        <p><strong>YOUNG STAN LEE WROTE OBITUARIES.</strong> Before writing about the fantastic lives of fictional characters, Stan Lee wrote antemortem obituaries for celebrities at an undisclosed news office in New York. He says that he eventually quit that job because it was too "depressing."</p>
        <p><strong>AN ISSUE AT THE PRINTERS TURNED THE HULK GREEN.</strong> The character was supposed to be gray, but Lee writes that the printer had a hard time keeping the color consistent. “So as of issue #2,” Lee writes, “with no explanation, he turned green.”</p>
